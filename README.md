# Brothers 2.0

Recreation of a project from back in the day, its objetive is a hip-hop focused one-page website, old-school/new-school, with a dynamic design, sofisticated and differentiated. 

It has been 1 year since my last update. Now, sporting a lot more knowledge, I decided to remake this project from scratch, without use of Bootstrap. So, next update, the entire code will be overhauled.

Future goals:

- [x] Optimization
- [x] Animations
- [ ] Responsivity
- [ ] Forms with Javascript

Technologies:
- HTML5
- CSS3/SASS
- Javascript/jQuery
